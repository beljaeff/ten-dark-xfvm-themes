## Xfwm Themes
My window manager flat theme with 5px borders and 32px height title.
There are three variants on this theme:
 - ten-dark-variant-red: close button always red;
 - ten-dark-variant: close button red when hover or pressed;
 - ten-dark: close button never red, just like others;
 I use ten-dark-variant with [Arc](https://github.com/NicoHood/arc-theme) GTK theme.
